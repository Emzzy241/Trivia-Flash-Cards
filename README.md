## Description
_In this great application I made use of the Trivia API to have amazing features incorporated into my App, below I will be giving users instructions on how to set up this amazing application on their Laptops. Have you ever wished to see an application where you get questions and when you click on those questions you get an answer? then this is the right Application for you_

## Setup/Installation
* First clone the project on your System(git clone _REPOSITORY-NAME_)
* Run npm install in the Terminal(e.g the git bash Terminal). with this, all of the dependencies of the application gets installed
* Then before running an "npm run start" which will build and start the application on a dev server here are a few things you will be needing for the application and those few things are:
* 1. An Environmental variable file: just create a file named .env(note: this is the place where you will be storing sensitive information like API keys and the likes)
* 2. Go to the website(INput THE SITE HERE EMMANUEL) or just type in iNPUT_THE_SITE_HERE
* 3. Create a developer account which will make you able to generate API keys you will be needing for this application
* 4. Generate an API key with a name of your choice, now copy that api key(hint: an API key characters ranges from 20-25 characters) and then go to the .env file you created and in it create a variable(hint: variables created in a .env file are all capitalized and have an underscore_ separating each word) you can name your variable anything and then store your api key to be equal to that variable you created
* 5. Having done that, inside the index.js javascript file check to see a variable where I stored my openweathermap link in(endpoint) and in the "process.env.API_KEY" change it to a "process.env.API_KEY.THE_VARIABLE_NAME_YOU_STORED_YOUR_API_KEY_IN"
* 6. Ensure you take part in the no5 otherwise you'll get a "401: invalid api key" error. If you do get lost on the way, you can contact me below with the contact details I supplied below
